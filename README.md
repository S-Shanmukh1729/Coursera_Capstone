# Coursera_Capstone

  This repository is created for the purpose of submmiting assingmnet in Coursera for the final Course of *IBM DataScience Specialisation* i.e **applied data science capstone**
  
  
  In this Course I learned About *K-Means CLustering, Location Data Providers Such as Foursquare and using their API and Applied that knowledege in creating the final project*
  
  In the Final Project we explored New York City and the city of Toronto and segmented and clustered their neighborhoods. Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. Is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city? I will leave it to you to refine this idea.
And Answered Questions like In a city of your choice, if someone is looking to open a restaurant, where would you recommend that they open it? Similarly, if a contractor is trying to start their own business, where would you recommend that they setup their office?
